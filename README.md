# Data-Collection


# Milestone 1

Github was used to create a new repository called 'Data-Collection' where changes will be tracked. Different feature branches will be created for each independant feature added and this will be merged into the main branch using 'git merge <new branch>' whilst on the main branch. Therefore, no new feature should be added on the main branch, rather on the newly created branches, merged before deleting the new branch.
