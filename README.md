# Data-Collection


# Milestone 1

Github was used to create a new repository called 'Data-Collection' where changes will be tracked. Different feature branches will be created for each independant feature added and this will be merged into the main branch using 'git merge <new branch>' whilst on the main branch. Therefore, no new feature should be added on the main branch, rather on the newly created branches, merged before deleting the new branch.
  
  
# Milestone 2
  
Before moving into the coding for a scraper, I had to select a website where I would gather information from. I chose a website that would be associated with items which I show interest in. For such a website, I selected the 'MyProtein' site as the layout is simple and clear.

The items sold on the website is also an interest of mine
